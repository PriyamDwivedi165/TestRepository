# TestRepository By Jake Vanderplas

This is a repository for demonstrating the process of doing a pull request.

The README is a useful file for including general information about the repository and its contents.
It is rendered using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is essentially a
way to create readable plain-text documents that can be rendered as web pages or other media formats.
